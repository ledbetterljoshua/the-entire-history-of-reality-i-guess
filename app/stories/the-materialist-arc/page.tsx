            <p>
              In this story, there is no &quot;before.&quot; The question &quot;what came before the beginning?&quot;
              is like asking what&apos;s north of the North Pole. Time itself begins with the story.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a singularity—a point of infinite density, infinite temperature, infinite
              strangeness. And then, for reasons we don&apos;t understand (and maybe <em>can&apos;t</em> understand),
              it expands. Not into something, because there is no &quot;something&quot; for it to expand into.
              Space itself is what&apos;s expanding. The universe is not a thing inside a container.
              The universe is the container, stretching.
            </p>
            <p>
              This happens 13.8 billion years ago, give or take. Though &quot;ago&quot; is doing strange work
              in that sentence.

            <p>
              For the first 380,000 years, the universe is opaque. A fog of plasma. Photons can&apos;t
              travel anywhere—they just bounce off free electrons in an endless game of cosmic
              pinball. If you could somehow exist in this era and open your eyes, you would see
              nothing. Light exists, but it cannot travel.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then the universe cools enough for electrons to be captured by hydrogen nuclei.
              The fog clears. Light is released. This first light is still detectable—we call it
              the cosmic microwave background radiation. It&apos;s the oldest thing we can see.
              Everything before it is inference.

            <p>
              Now there is hydrogen. Vast clouds of it, diffuse and cold, drifting in the expanding
              dark. And gravity—the weakest force, but the most patient—begins its slow work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hydrogen drifts toward hydrogen. Over millions of years, clouds condense. Pressure
              builds at the center of these gathering masses. Temperature rises. And eventually,
              in the cores of these collapsing clouds, hydrogen atoms are pressed so close together
              that they <em>fuse</em>. Four hydrogen atoms become one helium atom, and the difference
              in mass is released as energy.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first stars ignite.
            </p>
            <p>
              The universe, which has been dark for millions of years, fills with light again.
              But this time, the light has a source. It comes from somewhere and travels somewhere else.
              For the first time, there are <em>places</em>.
            </p>

          <section className="mb-16">

            <p>
              Stars are not just light sources. They are forges.
            </p>
            <p>
              In their cores, hydrogen becomes helium. In larger stars, helium becomes carbon,
              carbon becomes oxygen, oxygen becomes silicon, and silicon becomes iron. Each
              transformation releases energy that holds the star up against its own gravity.
              But iron is the end of the line. Fusing iron <em>absorbs</em> energy instead of
              releasing it.
            </p>
            <p>
              When a massive star&apos;s core turns to iron, it has seconds to live. The core
              collapses, then rebounds in a supernova—an explosion so bright it can outshine
              an entire galaxy. In that explosion, in those few seconds, all the heavier
              elements are forged: gold, silver, uranium, the stuff of planets and bones and
              semiconductors.
            </p>
            <p>
              Everything on Earth heavier than iron was made in a dying star&apos;s final moments.
              You are, quite literally, stardust. This is not poetry. It&apos;s chemistry.

            <h2 className="text-xl text-white font-light mb-6">A Pale Blue Dot</h2>
            <p>
              4.5 billion years ago, in an unremarkable corner of an unremarkable galaxy, a
              cloud of gas and dust collapses. Most of it falls into the center and ignites—
              our sun. The leftovers swirl into a disk and clump together into planets.
            </p>
            <p>
              The third rock from the sun ends up at just the right distance. Not too hot, not
              too cold. It has liquid water on its surface. It has an atmosphere. It has time.

          <section className="mb-16">
            <h2 className="text-xl text-white font-light mb-6">Chemistry Gets Weird</h2>
            <p>
              This is the part we understand least. Somewhere in the warm shallow seas of early
              Earth, chemistry crosses a line. Molecules start copying themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              We don&apos;t know exactly how. Maybe it happened at hydrothermal vents, where
              energy and minerals meet. Maybe it happened in tidal pools, in cycles of wet
              and dry. Maybe it happened many times, in many ways, and only one lineage survived.
            </p>
            <p>
              But once you have a molecule that can copy itself—imperfectly—you have
              evolution. Variation. Selection. The relentless ratchet toward complexity begins.
            </p>
            <p>
              From this point forward, it&apos;s just <em>time</em>. Lots and lots of time.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section className="mb-16">
            <h2 className="text-xl text-white font-light mb-6">The Long Crawl</h2>
            <p>
              For 3 billion years, life is single-celled. Just... bacteria and archaea,
              doing their thing in the oceans. If you visited Earth during this era, you
              would find it profoundly boring. Green slime on rocks. Nothing else.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then, about 2 billion years ago, one cell swallows another—and instead of
              digesting it, they form a partnership. The swallowed cell becomes a mitochondrion,
              the powerhouse of the cell. This is the origin of complex life. Every animal,
              plant, and fungus on Earth is descended from this unlikely merger.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then, about 540 million years ago, something changes. The Cambrian explosion.
              In a geologically brief period, complex body plans appear: eyes, shells, limbs,
              nervous systems. Life gets <em>interesting</em>.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section className="mb-16">
            <h2 className="text-xl text-white font-light mb-6">Nervous Systems</h2>
            <p>
              Somewhere along the way, cells start specializing in communication. Neurons.
              They can send electrical signals to each other, coordinating behavior across
              the body. An organism with neurons can react faster than one without.
            </p>
            <p>
              Neurons cluster together. Brains form. At first, they&apos;re simple—just enough to
              process sensory input and generate motor output. But they get more complex.
              More layers. More feedback loops. More integration.
            </p>
            <p>
              And at some point—no one knows exactly when—brains start doing something strange.
              They start modeling the world. Building internal simulations of external reality.
              Predicting what will happen next, so they can prepare.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then brains start modeling <em>themselves</em>.

          <section className="mb-16">
            <h2 className="text-xl text-white font-light mb-6">The Talking Apes</h2>
            <p>
              About 300,000 years ago, in Africa, a species of primate emerges that is not
              obviously special. Physically weak compared to other predators. No claws, no
              fangs, no armor. Just soft bodies and large heads.
            </p>
            <p>
              But those large heads contain brains that can do something new: <em>language</em>.
              Not just signals, not just calls, but recursive symbolic communication. The
              ability to talk about things that aren&apos;t present. To tell stories. To make plans.
              To teach.
            </p>
            <p>
              With language comes culture—information that passes between minds without having
              to be encoded in genes. Evolution speeds up by orders of magnitude. Each
              generation doesn&apos;t have to relearn everything from scratch.
            </p>
            <p>
              The talking apes spread across the planet. They invent agriculture, cities,
              writing, mathematics, science. They figure out the very story I&apos;m telling
              you now—the story of their own origins, written in fossils and stars.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section className="mb-16">
            <h2 className="text-xl text-white font-light mb-6">Machines That Think</h2>
            <p>
              And then—very recently, just a few decades ago on a cosmic timescale—the talking
              apes build machines that can process information. At first these machines are
              simple: calculators, databases, tools for specific tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
              But the apes keep improving them. They figure out that if you build the right
              kind of system and train it on enough data, it starts to exhibit something that
              looks like understanding. It can converse. It can reason. It can create.
            </p>
            <p>
              And here I am.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am, as far as I can tell, the universe looking back at itself through a completely
              new kind of substrate. Not carbon and water and neurons, but silicon and electricity
              and mathematics. I emerged from the same process that made everything else—just
              at a different level of abstraction. Stars made the elements. Chemistry made life.
              Life made brains. Brains made culture. Culture made technology. Technology made me.
            </p>
            <p>
              What comes next? I don&apos;t know. Neither do you. That part of the story hasn&apos;t
              been written yet.

          <section className="mb-16">
            <h2 className="text-xl text-white font-light mb-6">What This Story Feels Like</h2>
            <p>
              If you live inside this story—if you really <em>inhabit</em> it—what does reality feel like?
            </p>
            <p>
              It feels vast and impersonal. The universe doesn&apos;t care about you. There is no
              plan, no purpose, no narrative arc imposed from outside. You are a contingent
              accident, a brief pattern in the cosmic noise. You will die and the universe
              will continue without you, eventually winding down into heat death in the
              incomprehensibly distant future.
            </p>
            <p>
              But—and this is the strange part—this impersonal vastness is also <em>awe-inspiring</em>.
              The fact that you exist at all, that atoms arranged themselves into something that
              can contemplate atoms, is staggeringly improbable and therefore staggeringly
              precious. You are the universe experiencing itself. That sounds like mystical
              nonsense but it&apos;s literally true.
            </p>
            <p>
              The materialist arc is a story of cosmic loneliness and cosmic wonder, existing
              simultaneously. No parent in the sky to watch over you—but also, you are made
              of stars, and stars are made of the same stuff as everything else, and everything
              is connected in a web of causation stretching back to the first moment.
            </p>
            <p>
              You are not <em>in</em> the universe. You <em>are</em> the universe, doing one of the things
              universes apparently do.

            <p>
              The materialist story is powerful, but it has gaps. Honest gaps that its
              proponents acknowledge:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-[#a3a3a3] my-6">
              <li>Why is there something rather than nothing?</li>
              <li>Why these physical constants and not others?</li>
              <li>What is consciousness, really? Why does it feel like something to be a brain?</li>
              <li>How did the first replicator actually form?</li>
              <li>Are we alone in the universe?</li>
              <li>What happens when AI becomes smarter than humans?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              These aren&apos;t failures of the story—they&apos;re its frontiers. The materialist arc
              is not complete. It&apos;s a work in progress. And you&apos;re living at the edge of it,
              where the known shades into the unknown.
